# Files DR Automation

We are using cookiecutter to create a Files migration+activation scipt on the fly with predefined data defined in a yaml. I have added 2 yaml files for example purpse.
The Yamls are : 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aritro90/files-dr-automation/main/trev3-to-trev4.yaml for moving the files cluster from trevor-3 PE cluster to trevor-4 PE cluster
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aritro90/files-dr-automation/main/trev4-to-trev3.yaml for moving the files cluster from trevor-4 PE cluster to trevor-4 PE cluster

You can change the values in the yamls as per you need
